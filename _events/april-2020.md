Our monthly business meetings are a space where we hear report backs from our campaigns and for our membership to make decisions on the organizing and broader work we're doing in the city. The IWW NYC GMB meets on the second Tuesday of each month for general business meetings, but we have committees that meet regularly, monthly orientations, and actions on a weekly basis.

We ask for new members and folks curious in the union to attend an orientation or meet with a delegate before attending a monthly business meeting. Email us at <mailto:organize@wobblycity.org> ([public key](/assets/keys/publickey.organize@wobblycity.org.asc)) and we'll connect you with an IWW delegate who you can meet with one-on-one!

Interested in joining? [Join online]({{ site.baseurl }}/join) or in-person with a delegate.

We use [Rusty's Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rustys-rules-of-order) at our business meeting.

Email <mailto:organize@wobblycity.org> ([public key]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/keys/publickey.organize@wobblycity.org.asc)) for location details.
