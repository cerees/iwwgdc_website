  <ol>
    <li>The name of this chartered body of the IWW is the New York City General Membership Branch (GMB).</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Membership in the GMB shall be open to all IWW members not represented by other Industrial Union Branches or GMBs. Ability to participate in meetings, including the right to vote will be determined by the dues status of a member.</li>
    <li>IWW members from other Industrial Union Branches or other General Membership Branches may be allowed voice in the affairs of the GMB, if they are approved by a majority of GMB membership at a regularly scheduled business meeting. Members from the NYC area who do not pay dues to GMB Delegates may also be granted voice in meetings. Non-members may also be allowed voice at a meeting if approved by a majority of members at the meeting.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <h2 id="article-3">Article 3: Meetings</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>A quorum of five (5) GMB members in Good Standing must be present to conduct the meeting.</li>

The GMB may authorize additional business meetings during the month as needed. Other meetings of the Branch may be called for the purpose of discussion and strategizing.</li>
    <li>Members present and in good standing at meetings will be able to vote. Anyone more than two months behind on their dues will not be able to vote, unless approved by those present at the meeting. Assembled Members have the final say in the level of participation of workers in bad standing.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <h2 id="article-4">Article 4: Officers</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The GMB shall elect a Branch Secretary-Treasurer (BST) for one year terms, to begin on January 1st.

The duties of Branch Secretary-Treasurer shall be appointed to the individuals receiving the majority number of votes for each position. Instant runoff voting shall be used in cases of more than two candidates per office. Departing Branch Secretary-Treasurers are expected to spend at least one month training their replacements.</li>
    <li>The GMB shall elect a four member Administration Committee to work alongside the Branch Secretary-Treasurer to fulfill tasks such as sending regular emails to our members, managing the membership list, creating meeting agendas, and coordinating the branch’s internal communications.

Prior to serving, members of the Administration Committee must have been IWW members for a minimum of six (6) months.</li>

  <h2 id="article-8">Article 8: Online Voting</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Quorum: Quorum is only for ensuring that there is enough interest in and approval of online voting to allow it to be used for the year. Quorum is not registration for online voting. The process of calculating quorum are as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>On January 10th, April 10th, July 10th, and October 10th of each year, the Branch Secretary-Treasurer and Administration Committee will create a Loomio poll which will be shared with all members of the GMB over all official GMB communication channels to calculate quarterly quorum. The poll will be open for one week.</li>
        <li>This poll will include a question asking the member whether they intend to participate in online voting for the GMB for that year.</li>
        <li>If the member answers in the affirmative, they will be recorded as an online quorum member for that year.</li>
        <li>Should the member answer in the negative or provide no response to the poll by the deadline, they will be not be considered an online quorum member for that year.</li>
        <li>Online quorum members will hold no privileges over non-online quorum members.</li>
        <li>The number of respondents will be used only to calculate quorum, which requires approval from at least 15 members.</li>
        <li>Members’ responses will be due one month from when the poll is shared.</li>
        <li>For each quarter that we calculate quorum, a new Loomio subgroup will be created for that period before the next quarterly census.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Online Voting Process: Online voting shall occur only on an official platform for online voting. The stages of the online voting process are as follows:
      <ol>

        <li>A minimum three (3)-day discussion period will begin if the proposal is seconded. During this period, the proposal can be debated. This period can be extended to one week upon the proposal of extension and its seconding.</li>
        <li>Members of the GMB may amend the proposal at the discretion of the initial member who proposed it. If a proposal is amended, the final vote shall be on the amended version of the language as it stands once the discussion period is concluded.</li>
        <li>During the discussion period, alternative proposals on the same topic may be added for consideration by a seconded motion in an official GMB communication channel. Alternative proposals may be withdrawn by their sponsors and may also be amended as described in Article 2.c of the GMB Online Voting Bylaws.</li>
        <li>Upon the conclusion of the discussion period, a three-day voting period will begin via a poll created on an official electronic voting platform and shared in official GMB communication channels. The poll will be emitted to all members of the GMB for vote. If any alternative proposals were made, the vote shall be a ranked choice vote including each alternative along with “no action.” Members may change their vote prior to the conclusion of the voting period. The poll shall be timed to close at the end of the voting period.</li>
        <li>A majority vote of respondents is required in order to pass the proposal.</li>
        <li>If an online motion receives two blocks, it will be pushed to the next GMB meeting as new business and will require a new second.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Emergency Online Voting Process: Motions made which the motivator believes are of an urgent nature and should be within a 24 hour period must be in a separate Emergency Motions subgroup.
      <ol>
        <li>Emergency motions must receive at least 1.5x quorum in participants and must pass with a ⅔ majority.</li>
        <li>Emergency motions will not have options to abstain or block.</li>
        <li>Motions that change the language of branch bylaws are not subject to emergency status.</li>
        <li>Motions that exceed spending more than $800 are not subject to emergency status.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>All online motions between meetings must be included in the next meeting agenda and recorded in meeting minutes even if their reading is skipped.</li>
    <li>Election of Officers: Online voting may not be used in the election of officers.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <h2 id="article-9">Article 9: Amendments</h2>

    <li>For a proposed amendment of these bylaws to be approved for referendum, a written motion stating the amended articles, or article to be added, must be endorsed by at least 10 GMB members in good standing, or endorsed by a regular monthly branch meeting.</li>
  </ol><br>
